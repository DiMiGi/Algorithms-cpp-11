# Algorithms-cpp-11

- The algorithms exposed here are not for competitive programming, they are for comprehension and to understand what does the algorithm.
- The algorithms are written as a template of c++, that means that you can use the same code for differents type of data.
- The algorithms were compiled on Windows, that is the reason why there is a file called "libstdc++-6.dll"

To compile the algorithm the next line is used:
  g++ -std=c++0x algorithm.cpp -o prog -W
  
To run the compiled algorithm the next line is used:
  prog < Inputs/input_name

If it does not have an input file just "prog" is used instead
